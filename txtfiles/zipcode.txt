Second Two Digits of ZIP Codes Indicate the City
The USPS assigns the second two digits in a ZIP Code to denote a city. 
If a specific geographical region has a central town or city, 
then the first ZIP Codes are assigned to that city.
Once that is done, the ZIP codes get assigned in alphabetical order.
